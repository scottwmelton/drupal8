# Comment advanced

## What does it provides
Core in Drupal 8 allows to specficy multiple comment types. While this is nice
there are some UX problems with it:

* The widget itself always has the same title. This module provides a widget to
  make those titles configurable.
* The comment formatter (renders out the comments + the comment form) always
  shows 'Add new comment' as title. This module allows to configure that as well
